  abstract   = {In contrast to conventional teaching agents (including robots) that were designed to play the role of human teachers or caregivers, we propose the opposite scenario in which robots receive instruction or care from children. We hypothesize that by using this care-receiving robot, we may construct a new educational framework whose goal is to promote children's spontaneous learning by teaching through their teaching the robot. In this paper, we describe the introduction of a care-receiving robot into a classroom at an English language school for Japanese children (3--6 years of age) and then conduct an experiment to evaluate if the care-receiving robot can promote their learning using English verbs. The results suggest that the idea of a care-receiving robot is feasible and that the robot can help children learn new English verbs efficiently. In addition, we report on investigations into several forms of teaching performed by children, which were revealed through observations of the children, parent interviews, and other useful knowledge. These can be used to improve the design of care-receiving robots for educational purposes.},

In this paper, we detail our co-design process used to engage adolescents in the design of a social robot prototype intended to broadly support their mental health. Data gathered from our four week design study of nine remote sessions and interviews with 16 adolescents suggested the following design requirements for a home robot: (1) be able to enact a set of roles including a coach, companion, and confidant; (2) amplify human-to-human connection by supporting peer relationships; (3) account for data privacy and device ownership. Design materials are available in open-access, contributing to best practices for the field of Human-Robot Interaction.},

  abstract  = {Teachable robots are a promising technology to promote engagement in the classroom for young students. They are capable of displaying and adapting different social behaviours and characteristics, such as speech, gaze, and vocal pitch, to personalise the teaching interaction, and sustain interest for students over time. Research in this field shows a growing use of reinforcement learning to achieve this adaptation, however there is limited research on adaptive dialog behaviours for teachable robots. Our work proposes an adaptive dialog selection algorithm, implemented using Q-learning, which aims to personalise the dialog choices of a teachable robot in order to optimise for task engagement, measured by the time taken per teaching input, and the amount paraphrasing in the user{\textquoteright}s response. We investigate the effect of this approach in a case study with children aged 9â€“10 years old. The results show that this demographic responds positively to the teaching interaction, and provide useful insights into their preferences and abilities.},

  abstract = {<p>Wizard-of-Oz experiments play a vital role in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), as they allow for quick and simple hypothesis testing. Still, a publicly available general tool to conduct such experiments is currently not available in the research community, and researchers often develop and implement their own tools, customized for each individual experiment. Besides being inefficient in terms of programming efforts, this also makes it harder for non-technical researchers to conduct Wizard-of-Oz experiments. In this paper, we present a general and easy-to-use tool for the Pepper robot, one of the most commonly used robots in this context. While we provide the concrete interface for Pepper robots only, the system architecture is independent of the type of robot and can be adapted for other robots. A configuration file, which saves experiment-specific parameters, enables a quick setup for reproducible and repeatable Wizard-of-Oz experiments. A central server provides a graphical interface <italic>via</italic> a browser while handling the mapping of user input to actions on the robot. In our interface, keyboard shortcuts may be assigned to phrases, gestures, and composite behaviors to simplify and speed up control of the robot. The interface is lightweight and independent of the operating system. Our initial tests confirm that the system is functional, flexible, and easy to use. The interface, including source code, is made commonly available, and we hope that it will be useful for researchers with any background who want to conduct HRI experiments.</p>}

  abstract = {The rapid advancement of technology empowered by artificial intelligence is believed to intensify the collaboration between humans and AI as team partners. Successful collaboration requires partners to learn about each other and about the task. This human-AI co-learning can be achieved by presenting situations that enable partners to share knowledge and experiences. In this paper we describe the development and implementation of a task context and procedures for studying co-learning. More specifically, we designed specific sequences of interactions that aim to initiate and facilitate the co-learning process. The effects of these interventions on learning were evaluated in an experiment, using a simplified virtual urban-search-and-rescue task for a human-robot team. The human participants performed a victim rescue- and evacuation mission in collaboration with a wizard-of-Oz (i.e., a confederate of the experimenter who executed the robot-behavior consistent with an ontology-based AI-model). The designed interaction sequences, formulated as Learning Design Patterns (LDPs), were intended to bring about co-learning. Results show that LDPs support the humans understanding and awareness of their robot partner and of the teamwork. No effects were found on collaboration fluency, nor on team performance. Results are used to discuss the importance of co-learning, the challenges of designing human-AI team tasks for research into this phenomenon, and the conditions under which co-learning is likely to be successful. The study contributes to our understanding of how humans learn with and from AI-partners, and our propositions for designing intentional learning (LDPs) provide directions for applications in future human-AI teams.}

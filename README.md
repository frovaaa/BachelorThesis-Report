This repository contains the source files and final PDF of Davide Frova's Bachelor Thesis at Università della Svizzera italiana (USI), conducted within the TESORO project at IDSIA.

## 📘 Thesis Overview

**Title:** Exploring the Learning by Teaching Paradigm with Social Robots  
**Subtitle:** Exploratory Studies on Learning by Teaching with Social Robots using Wizard-of-Oz Control  
**Author:** Davide Frova  
**Advisor:** Prof. Monica Landoni  
**Co-Advisor:** Antonio Paolillo  
**Institution:** Università della Svizzera italiana (USI)  
**Year:** 2025

The thesis explores how children can **teach a robot** to behave appropriately in social situations, within a **Learning by Teaching (LbT)** paradigm. It documents the development of a **Wizard-of-Oz control interface** for a RoboMaster EP robot and three iterative **walkthrough evaluations** involving children and HCI experts. The study investigates how children perceive, correct, and engage with the robot in a collaborative LEGO-building task.
